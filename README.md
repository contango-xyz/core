# Contango Protocol

Contango is bringing expirables to DeFi. Buy or sell assets at a set price and date in the future without order books or liquidity pools. When a trader opens a position, the protocol borrows on the fixed-rate market, swaps on the spot market, then lends back on the fixed-rate market. Contango offers physical delivery and a minimal price impact for larger trades. Join us at [contango.xyz](https://contango.xyz). 


## Smart Contracts

The smart contracts use an UUPS proxy as entry point, and rely on external libraries to split code/responsibilities whilst keeping the execution context under a single address.
At the moment there's a single implementation of underlying Spot (Uniswap V3), and a single implementation of fixed rate market (Yield Protocol)
